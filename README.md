# MovieList
## Arcitechure
For this app I use MVC-S model. 

## UI
No storyboards. Just my preference. I use UICollectionView to display a list of the movies. After a user is tapping on the cell they are forwarded to detal screen whitch is a simple view controller with a stack view of UI elements. 

## Service. 
I ustilise a service singleton to make a request to the end point and update my UI.
